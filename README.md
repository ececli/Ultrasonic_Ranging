# Ultrasonic Ranging for Two Raspberry Pi

The purpose of this project is to obtain ranging estimation between two Raspberry Pi. To obtain accurate ranging, we deploy ultrasonic transmitter and receiver on a Raspberry Pi, and estimate the time-of-flight (ToF) to get the distance. The conventional two-way ranging method is applied.
